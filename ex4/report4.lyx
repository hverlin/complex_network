Briefly describe the distributions: are they Gaussian, power laws or something

\end_layout

We can see that the distributions looks like power laws with fat tails.

Questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Which of the two approaches (linear or logarithmic x-axes) suits this for
 presenting how 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle w\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 scales as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

? Why?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The log approche is better because it will show global trend way more easely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
In social networks, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle w\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 typically decreases as a function of the degree due to time constraints
 required for taking care of social contacts.
 Are your results in accordance with this conception? If not, how would
 you explain your finding?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not that visible on the graph.
 There is a small decrease of the weight versus the degree at the end o
 f the graph, but only at the very end.
 Otherwise, the global trend is increasing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The network of the exercise is not an accurate social network for small
 degree nodes: on Facebook for example is you have less than 10 friends,
 you are not using the website that much.
 That could explain the difference between this graph and a

 social graph.

Is this trend in accordance with the Granovetter hypothesis? If not, how
 would you explain your findings?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an increasing trend so it supports the hypothesis.

\begin_layout Subsection
For which of the four approaches is the network most and least vulnerable?
 In other words, in which case does the giant component shrink fastest /
 slowest? Or is this even simple to define?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Most vunerable: descendig order of edges betweeness centrality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Least vunerable: descending link weight
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But it is not that easy to define as the network is not that vunerable against
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

descending order of edge betweness attack
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when there is already a lot of nodes removed for example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
When comparing the removal of links in ascending and descending order strong
 and weak links first, which ones are more important for the integrity of
 the network? Why do you think this would be the case?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most important for the integrity of the network is the weak links first
 as the one that have strong links have strong links between them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How would you explain the difference between the random removal strategy
 and the removal in descending order of edge betweenness strategy?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you attack using betweness you will remove the very important edge first,
 whereas if you attack the network randomly, it's not likely at all that
 you will hit an important edge at first.
 It could be but considering the size of the network, it is very unlikely.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
If the connections of Hawai are considered, how would you explain the difference
s between the minimal and maximal spanning trees?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The minimum spanning tree show a great number of links to Hawai that have
 a long distance.
 It is because the strength of the link represents the number of flight
 during the time period.
 Indeed, there are not so many flight that go to Hawai from a such long
 distance.
 This is more likely that a flight will go to California first, and then
 to Hawai.
 This is what we can see using the maximum spanning tree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
If you would like to understand the overall organization of the air traffic
 in US, would you use the minimal or maximal spanning tree? Why?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I would use the maximum spanning tree as we can clearly see the hubs and
 the general directions of the air traffic.
 It is a lot more logical and meaningful.

How many links does the thresholded network share with the maximal spanning

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Given this number and the visualizations, does simple thresholding yield
 a similar network as the maximum spanning tree?

\begin_layout Standard
Not exactly as only

 of the edges are here in both cases.
